Processes are pretty much everything which works under the hood of the operating system.

Sometimes you may get pretty furious about some processes which are stuck , which prevents you, by holding on to ports and doesn’t allow you to start new processes, that is why you wanna kill, not because you are insane.

This term may seem brutal but, every killing opens opportunity for new born pretty processes. Look at that way.

Killing process is easy, what is hard is to find which one you intend to kill.

Once, i have written a long terminal command and was using it with back searching.
Such command was to kill 8080 process:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lsof -i4TCP:8080
#+END_SRC

Get related line
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lsof -i4TCP:8080 | tail -1
#+END_SRC

Find related column
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lsof -i4TCP:8080 | tail -1 | awk ‘{print $2}’ | xargs sudo kill
#+END_SRC

* It is time for _fkill_

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    npm install --global fkill-cli
  #+END_SRC

  It is also available at brew

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    brew install fkill
  #+END_SRC

* How to use _fkill_?
** List processes
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     fkill
   #+END_SRC

** Kill specific process that is bound to a known port
   Kills the process which is bound to 8080 port.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     fkill :8080
   #+END_SRC

** Kill a process through list, fkill helps auto completion.
